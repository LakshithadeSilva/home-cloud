# Home Cloud
This is an experimental project that cofirgures a group of baremetal servers as hypervisors and provision a specified number of guest VMs on them. This simple "cloud" setup should be nice way to setup a cost effective home lab. The hypervisors use Linux KVM and QEMU technologies, which are used extensively as type-2 hypervisors powering production cloud infrastructure.
